# Annual Report Mail Merge Tool

This is a program that was written to help streamline the process of generating the annual report -- a compilation of the research grant recipients from the Wisconsin Space Grant Consortium. This allows for users to upload a simple excel sheet with the template provided and generate a Microsoft Word Document of the Final Report, sorted by last name of the recipient and their congressional district.

It takes the excel sheet and does a mail merge on the approporiate template with the information provided. This helped reduce the amount of time the report took to generate from a couple of months to a couple of minutes. 

Future work could include adding templated images of the recipients using a templated XML document.
